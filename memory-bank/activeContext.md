# WhatsApp Gateway Active Context

## Current Status

The WhatsApp Gateway project is currently in a functional state with core features implemented. The application provides a web interface and API for managing WhatsApp sessions, sending messages, and scheduling future messages. The system uses the Baileys library to interact with WhatsApp Web and provides a user-friendly interface for non-technical users.

## Recent Changes

- Initial project setup with Express.js and EJS templates
- Implementation of the Session Manager for WhatsApp session handling
- Development of API endpoints for session and message management
- Creation of web interface for session creation and management
- Implementation of bulk messaging with templates
- Addition of message scheduling functionality

## Current Focus

The current focus is on enhancing the WhatsApp Gateway with AI capabilities to enable automated responses to incoming messages. This involves:

1. **AI Integration Planning**: Determining the best approach for integrating AI capabilities into the existing architecture.
2. **AI Model Selection**: Evaluating different AI models or services that can be used for generating responses.
3. **User Interface Updates**: Planning updates to the user interface to support AI configuration and management.
4. **API Enhancements**: Designing new API endpoints for AI-related functionality.

## Active Decisions

### AI Integration Approach
- **Decision Needed**: Whether to use an external AI service (e.g., OpenAI, Dialogflow) or implement a simpler rule-based system.
- **Considerations**: Cost, complexity, response quality, and integration effort.
- **Current Thinking**: An external AI service would provide better quality responses but at a higher cost and complexity.

### AI Configuration
- **Decision Needed**: How users will configure the AI behavior (e.g., instructions, templates, examples).
- **Considerations**: User experience, flexibility, and complexity.
- **Current Thinking**: A simple form-based approach with text areas for instructions and example conversations.

### Context Management
- **Decision Needed**: How to store and manage conversation context for AI responses.
- **Considerations**: Storage requirements, performance impact, and context window limitations.
- **Current Thinking**: Store recent conversation history in memory with configurable limits, with optional persistence to disk.

## Next Steps

1. **Research AI Integration Options**:
   - Evaluate available AI services and their APIs
   - Assess costs and limitations
   - Determine integration requirements

2. **Design AI Configuration Interface**:
   - Create mockups for AI settings page
   - Define configuration parameters
   - Plan user experience flow

3. **Implement Basic AI Integration**:
   - Create new module for AI service integration
   - Develop API endpoints for AI configuration
   - Implement message processing logic

4. **Enhance Session Manager**:
   - Add support for AI-powered responses
   - Implement context management
   - Create hooks for incoming message processing

5. **Update User Interface**:
   - Add AI configuration page
   - Enhance session detail view to show AI status
   - Provide feedback on AI response quality

6. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Test AI responses with various scenarios
   - Gather feedback on response quality
   - Refine AI configuration options

## Open Questions

1. How should the system handle AI service outages or failures?
2. What metrics should be tracked to evaluate AI response quality?
3. Should users be able to review and approve AI responses before sending?
4. How can the system handle different languages and cultural contexts?
5. What privacy considerations need to be addressed when processing messages with AI?

## Current Challenges

1. **WhatsApp API Limitations**: The unofficial nature of the Baileys library means that WhatsApp updates could break functionality.
2. **Scalability**: The current file-based storage approach may not scale well with many sessions or messages.
3. **AI Integration Complexity**: Integrating AI capabilities while maintaining a simple user experience is challenging.
4. **Context Management**: Efficiently managing conversation context without excessive resource usage.
5. **User Education**: Helping users understand how to effectively configure AI behavior.
