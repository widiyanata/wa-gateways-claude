## Known Issues

1. **Session Reconnection**: Occasionally, sessions may not reconnect properly after server restart.
   - **Status**: Under investigation
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Workaround**: Manually refresh the session

2. **QR Code Timeout**: QR codes may expire before being scanned, requiring manual refresh.
   - **Status**: Known limitation
   - **Priority**: Low
   - **Workaround**: Click refresh button to generate a new QR code

3. **Scheduled Message Reliability**: Scheduled messages may not send if the server is restarted before the scheduled time.
   - **Status**: Known limitation of in-memory scheduling
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Workaround**: Reschedule important messages after server restart

4. **Media Message Size Limits**: Large media files may fail to send due to WhatsApp limitations.
   - **Status**: Known limitation of WhatsApp
   - **Priority**: Low
   - **Workaround**: Reduce file size before sending

## Next Milestone: AI Integration Enhancements

The AI Integration MVP has been implemented with the following features:

1. **Basic AI Integration**:
   - AI service integration module with placeholder for external AI service
   - Simple instruction-based configuration
   - Basic conversation context management

2. **User Interface Updates**:
   - AI configuration tab in session detail view
   - Toggle for enabling/disabling AI for each session
   - Test interface for trying AI responses
   - Conversation history viewer

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - Get and update AI configuration
   - Get and clear conversation history
   - Test AI responses
   - Process messages with AI

The next steps for enhancing the AI integration include:

1. **External AI Service Integration**:
   - Connect to a real AI service (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
   - Implement proper API key management
   - Handle rate limiting and quotas

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - Improve conversation context management
   - Add AI response quality feedback
   - Implement fallback mechanisms for AI failures

3. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive test cases for AI response scenarios
   - Documentation for AI configuration
   - Usage guidelines for effective AI instruction

**Target Completion**: TBD

## Overall Project Status

The WhatsApp Gateway is currently in a functional state with all core features implemented and the AI Integration MVP in place. The system now has the foundation for AI-powered automated responses to incoming messages, with a placeholder implementation that can be connected to an external AI service. The modular architecture has proven effective, allowing for the integration of new components without significant changes to the existing codebase.

**Current Phase**: AI Integration Implementation
