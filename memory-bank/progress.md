## Known Issues

1. **Session Reconnection**: Occasionally, sessions may not reconnect properly after server restart.
   - **Status**: Under investigation
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Workaround**: Manually refresh the session

2. **QR Code Timeout**: QR codes may expire before being scanned, requiring manual refresh.
   - **Status**: Known limitation
   - **Priority**: Low
   - **Workaround**: Click refresh button to generate a new QR code

3. **Scheduled Message Reliability**: Scheduled messages may not send if the server is restarted before the scheduled time.
   - **Status**: Known limitation of in-memory scheduling
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Workaround**: Reschedule important messages after server restart

4. **Media Message Size Limits**: Large media files may fail to send due to WhatsApp limitations.
   - **Status**: Known limitation of WhatsApp
   - **Priority**: Low
   - **Workaround**: Reduce file size before sending

## Next Milestone: AI Integration Advanced Features

The AI Integration has been enhanced with the following features:

1. **Basic AI Integration**:
   - AI service integration module with placeholder for external AI service
   - Simple instruction-based configuration
   - Basic conversation context management

2. **User Interface Updates**:
   - AI configuration tab in session detail view
   - Toggle for enabling/disabling AI for each session
   - Test interface for trying AI responses
   - Conversation history viewer

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - Get and update AI configuration
   - Get and clear conversation history
   - Test AI responses
   - Process messages with AI

4. **External AI Service Integration**:
   - Connected to OpenAI API for generating responses
   - Added support for DeepSeek AI as an alternative provider
   - Implemented API key management in the UI for multiple providers
   - Added error handling for API failures

The next steps for further enhancing the AI integration include:

1. **Advanced Features**:
   - Improve conversation context management
   - Add AI response quality feedback
   - Implement more sophisticated fallback mechanisms for AI failures

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement caching for frequent requests
   - Add request throttling to manage API costs
   - Optimize context management for memory usage

3. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive test cases for AI response scenarios
   - Documentation for AI configuration
   - Usage guidelines for effective AI instruction

**Target Completion**: TBD

## Overall Project Status

The WhatsApp Gateway is currently in a functional state with all core features implemented and the AI Integration enhanced with multiple AI service providers. The system now provides AI-powered automated responses to incoming messages using either OpenAI or DeepSeek AI. The modular architecture has proven effective, allowing for the integration of new components and service providers without significant changes to the existing codebase.

**Current Phase**: AI Integration Advanced Features
