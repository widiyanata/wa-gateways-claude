# WhatsApp Gateway Active Context

## Current Status

The WhatsApp Gateway project is currently in a functional state with core features implemented and the AI Integration enhanced with multiple AI service providers. The application provides a web interface and API for managing WhatsApp sessions, sending messages, scheduling future messages, and now includes AI-powered automated responses using OpenAI or DeepSeek AI. The system uses the Baileys library to interact with WhatsApp Web and provides a user-friendly interface for non-technical users.

## Recent Changes

- Integration with OpenAI API for generating AI responses
- Added support for DeepSeek AI as an alternative provider
- Implementation of API key management in the UI for multiple providers
- Addition of error handling for API failures
- Update of AI configuration UI to support provider selection and API key input
- Update of AI models to match each provider's available models

## Current Focus

The current focus is on enhancing the AI integration with advanced features and optimizing performance. This involves:

1. **Advanced Context Management**: Improving the conversation context management for better AI responses.
2. **Response Quality Feedback**: Adding mechanisms for users to provide feedback on AI response quality.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implementing caching and request throttling to manage API costs.
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Creating more sophisticated fallback options for when the AI service is unavailable.

## Active Decisions

### Response Quality Feedback System
- **Decision Needed**: How to implement a feedback system for AI responses.
- **Considerations**: User experience, data collection, and feedback utilization.
- **Current Thinking**: Add simple thumbs up/down buttons after each AI response, with optional text feedback for negative ratings.

### Caching Strategy
- **Decision Needed**: How to implement caching for frequent AI requests.
- **Considerations**: Cache invalidation, storage requirements, and performance impact.
- **Current Thinking**: Implement a time-based cache for similar queries, with configurable expiration times.

### Context Management Optimization
- **Decision Needed**: How to optimize conversation context management for better performance.
- **Considerations**: Memory usage, context relevance, and API token limitations.
- **Current Thinking**: Implement a smart context window that prioritizes recent messages and important context, with automatic summarization for longer conversations.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Response Quality Feedback**:
   - Add UI elements for rating AI responses
   - Create backend storage for feedback data
   - Implement analytics for tracking response quality

2. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Implement caching system for frequent requests
   - Add request throttling to manage API costs
   - Optimize context management for memory usage

3. **Enhance Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - Create more sophisticated fallback responses
   - Implement automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Add offline mode capabilities for when API is unavailable

4. **Improve Documentation**:
   - Create comprehensive user guide for AI configuration
   - Document best practices for prompt engineering
   - Provide examples of effective AI instructions

5. **Add Advanced Features**:
   - Implement conversation summarization
   - Add support for different response formats
   - Create templates for common AI instructions

## Open Questions

1. How can we implement a cost management system to prevent excessive API usage?
2. Should we add a feature for users to review and approve AI responses before sending?
3. How can we best handle different languages and cultural contexts in AI responses?
4. What additional privacy measures are needed when processing messages with external AI services?
5. Should we implement a local fallback AI option for when external services are unavailable?
6. How can we measure and improve the effectiveness of AI responses over time?

## Current Challenges

1. **WhatsApp API Limitations**: The unofficial nature of the Baileys library means that WhatsApp updates could break functionality.
2. **Scalability**: The current file-based storage approach may not scale well with many sessions or messages.
3. **AI Service Reliability**: External AI services may have downtime or rate limits that affect functionality.
4. **Cost Management**: AI API usage costs can accumulate quickly with high message volume.
5. **Context Management**: Efficiently managing conversation context without excessive resource usage.
6. **User Education**: Helping users understand how to effectively configure AI behavior for optimal results.
7. **API Key Security**: Ensuring that user-provided API keys are stored securely.
8. **Provider Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent behavior across different AI service providers.
