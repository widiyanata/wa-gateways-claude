# WhatsApp Gateway Active Context

## Current Status

The WhatsApp Gateway project is currently in a functional state with core features implemented and the AI Integration MVP in place. The application provides a web interface and API for managing WhatsApp sessions, sending messages, scheduling future messages, and now includes the foundation for AI-powered automated responses. The system uses the Baileys library to interact with WhatsApp Web and provides a user-friendly interface for non-technical users.

## Recent Changes

- Implementation of AI service integration module
- Development of conversation context management system
- Creation of AI configuration UI in session detail view
- Addition of API endpoints for AI functionality
- Integration of AI processing with incoming messages

## Current Focus

The current focus is on enhancing the AI integration with a real external AI service and improving the user experience. This involves:

1. **External AI Service Integration**: Connecting to a real AI service like OpenAI or Claude to generate responses.
2. **API Key Management**: Implementing secure storage and management of API keys for AI services.
3. **Advanced Context Management**: Improving the conversation context management for better AI responses.
4. **User Experience Enhancements**: Adding feedback mechanisms and fallback options for AI responses.

## Active Decisions

### External AI Service Selection
- **Decision Needed**: Which external AI service to integrate with (OpenAI, Claude, etc.).
- **Considerations**: Cost, API availability, response quality, and integration complexity.
- **Current Thinking**: OpenAI's API is well-documented and widely used, making it a good initial choice, with Claude as a potential alternative.

### API Key Management
- **Decision Needed**: How to securely store and manage API keys for AI services.
- **Considerations**: Security, user experience, and flexibility.
- **Current Thinking**: Store API keys in environment variables or a secure configuration file, with a UI for users to enter their own keys.

### Advanced Context Management
- **Decision Needed**: How to improve conversation context management for better AI responses.
- **Considerations**: Memory usage, performance, and context window limitations.
- **Current Thinking**: Implement a more sophisticated context window that prioritizes recent messages and important context, with configurable retention policies.

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate with External AI Service**:
   - Select an AI service provider (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
   - Implement API client for the selected service
   - Add API key configuration options

2. **Enhance AI Response Generation**:
   - Improve prompt engineering for better responses
   - Implement response filtering and safety measures
   - Add support for different response formats (text, markdown, etc.)

3. **Implement Feedback Mechanisms**:
   - Add UI for rating AI responses
   - Collect and store feedback data
   - Use feedback to improve AI configuration

4. **Add Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - Implement error handling for AI service failures
   - Create fallback responses for when AI is unavailable
   - Add retry logic for failed requests

5. **Improve Documentation**:
   - Create user guide for AI configuration
   - Document best practices for prompt engineering
   - Provide examples of effective AI instructions

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize context management for memory usage
   - Implement caching for frequent requests
   - Add request throttling to manage API costs

## Open Questions

1. Should we support multiple AI service providers or focus on one?
2. How can we implement a cost management system to prevent excessive API usage?
3. Should we add a feature for users to review and approve AI responses before sending?
4. How can we best handle different languages and cultural contexts in AI responses?
5. What additional privacy measures are needed when processing messages with external AI services?
6. Should we implement a local fallback AI option for when external services are unavailable?

## Current Challenges

1. **WhatsApp API Limitations**: The unofficial nature of the Baileys library means that WhatsApp updates could break functionality.
2. **Scalability**: The current file-based storage approach may not scale well with many sessions or messages.
3. **AI Service Reliability**: External AI services may have downtime or rate limits that affect functionality.
4. **Cost Management**: AI API usage costs can accumulate quickly with high message volume.
5. **Context Management**: Efficiently managing conversation context without excessive resource usage.
6. **User Education**: Helping users understand how to effectively configure AI behavior for optimal results.
