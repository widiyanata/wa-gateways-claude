## Known Issues

1. **Session Reconnection**: Occasionally, sessions may not reconnect properly after server restart.
   - **Status**: Under investigation
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Workaround**: Manually refresh the session

2. **QR Code Timeout**: QR codes may expire before being scanned, requiring manual refresh.
   - **Status**: Known limitation
   - **Priority**: Low
   - **Workaround**: Click refresh button to generate a new QR code

3. **Scheduled Message Reliability**: Scheduled messages may not send if the server is restarted before the scheduled time.
   - **Status**: Known limitation of in-memory scheduling
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Workaround**: Reschedule important messages after server restart

4. **Media Message Size Limits**: Large media files may fail to send due to WhatsApp limitations.
   - **Status**: Known limitation of WhatsApp
   - **Priority**: Low
   - **Workaround**: Reduce file size before sending

## Next Milestone: AI Integration MVP

The next major milestone is to implement a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for AI-powered chat responses. This includes:

1. **Basic AI Integration**:
   - Integration with an external AI service
   - Simple instruction-based configuration
   - Basic context management

2. **User Interface Updates**:
   - AI configuration page
   - Toggle for enabling/disabling AI for each session
   - Basic feedback mechanism for AI responses

3. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Test cases for AI response scenarios
   - Documentation for AI configuration
   - Usage guidelines for effective AI instruction

**Target Completion**: TBD

## Overall Project Status

The WhatsApp Gateway is currently in a functional state with all core features implemented. The focus is now on enhancing the system with AI capabilities to enable automated responses to incoming messages. The current implementation provides a solid foundation for these enhancements, with a modular architecture that allows for the integration of new components without significant changes to the existing codebase.

**Current Phase**: AI Integration Planning
